                    <h3>Areas for improvement</h3>
                    <p>I have identified many areas of my skillset that I wish to improve. A prime example would be presenting. I donâ€™t particularly like to present, however, I recently done a presentation in an information systems lab on the system development life cycle and thought it was a huge success. This gives me confidence that I can achieve my goal, which is to be confident when being the centre of attention.</p>

                    <h3>What I think I'm good at</h3>
                    <p>I believe I am a fairly good problem solver. This shows when tackling programming problems on my university course. I am usually around the lab wanting to help friends with their programming. This is great for me too, because it helps me learn and have a greater understanding when thinking algorithmically.</p>

                    <h3>The next level</h3>
                    <p>There is always room for improvement and if I want to get to the next level, which I most certainly do, then the computer science degree I am undertaking at Manchester Metropolitan University is definitely the catalyst for attaining this.</p>
